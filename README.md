<h2> What is "im dead💀"?</h2>
This is a language based on GenZ speak of using a 💀 to show emotions of peak dying of laughter. It has slowly been replacing 😂 (joy), LMAO (laughing my a&% off) and LOL (laughing out loud). The number of 💀 per line correspond with an opcode. So the only tokens for the language are 💀 and "\n".
